Game 1: First, the player selects a game grid indicated by the circular buttons on the right side of the window. Once a game grid is selected, the player clicks a tile to swap it with the image tile. the player can only swap tiles directly above, below, to the left, or the right of the image tile. The number of clicks will be tracked and displayed at the bottom of the screen. To win the game, the player must arrange each tile in descending order from left to right, top to bottom. (15 in the top left corner, then 14 directly to the right. 11 will be in the space directly below 15.) This repeats until each number is in order and the image tile is in the bottom right corner. When all the requirements are met, the player wins the game, and the number of clicks is displayed with a congratulations message.
